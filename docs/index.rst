STM32MP135F eBook Reader Documentation
======================================

.. TODO: Add a picture of the device here

What is this?
-------------

This is an open source eBook reader based on the **STM32MP135F**.

I created this project because ebook readers are awesome and to better understand the ARM architecture.

Why should I care?
------------------

If you are curious how an eBook reader works internally, this documentation provides a practical overview of how such a device can be designed and implemented.

How do I start?
---------------

To follow along, you need the device.

If you do not have one but want to acquire it, contact me at: **TODO: add email address**.

The device consists of:

- an **STM32MP135F** single board computer,
- an Waveshare e-paper display https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/7.8inch-e-paper.htm,
- an **battery**,
- a **sd card**,
- and a **3D-printed enclosure**.

Each part is described in the sections below, but start with **Getting Started** to set up your workstation and begin working with the device.
